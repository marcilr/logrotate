logrotate - rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

Synopsis:
    logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file] config_file+

Description:
  logrotate  is  designed to ease administration of systems that generate
  large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression,
  removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily,
  weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

  Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.  It will not  modify  a
  log  multiple  times  in  one  day unless the criterium for that log is
  based on the log's size and logrotate is being run multiple times  each
  day, or unless the -f or -force option is used.

  Any number of config files may be given on the command line. Later con-
  fig files may override the options given in earlier files, so the order
  in  which  the logrotate config files are listed in is important.  Nor-
  mally, a single config file which includes any other config files which
  are  needed  should  be used.  See below for more information on how to
  use the include directive to accomplish this.  If a directory is  given
  on  the  command line, every file in that directory is used as a config
  file.

  If no command line arguments are given, logrotate  will  print  version
  and  copyright  information,  along with a short usage summary.  If any
  errors occur while rotating logs, logrotate  will  exit  with  non-zero
  status.

Log rotate:
  /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

Options
    -?, --help
           Prints help message.

    -d, --debug
           Turns  on  debug mode and implies -v.  In debug mode, no changes
           will be made to the logs or to the logrotate state file.

    -f, --force
           Tells logrotate to force the rotation, even if it doesn't  think
           this  is  necessary.   Sometimes this is useful after adding new
           entries to a logrotate config file, or if  old  log  files  have
           been removed by hand, as the new files will be created, and log-
           ging will continue correctly.

    -m, --mail <command>
           Tells logrotate which command to use  when  mailing  logs.  This
           command  should accept two arguments: 1) the subject of the mes-
           sage, and 2) the recipient. The command must then read a message
           on standard input and mail it to the recipient. The default mail
           command is /usr/bin/mail -s.

    -s, --state <statefile>
           Tells logrotate to use an alternate state file.  This is  useful
           if  logrotate  is being run as a different user for various sets
           of log files.  The default state file is /var/lib/logrotate/sta-
           tus.

    --usage
           Prints a short usage message.

    -v, --verbose
           Turns on verbose mode, ie. display messages during rotation.
